# R's own :rocket:-CS degree

## Scope of the document

My motivation for this is a fundament for the knowledge I have already spread out throughout several domains of CS. That is mainly **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** and a few bits and pieces in **System Design**.

Hence, I want a thorough and complete education in Informatics / Computer Science.

### Further Requirements/Notes

Duration
  : I want to finish this within 12 to 18 months with a weekly time spent of 10-20h.

`* [X]`
  : You can wake me up in the middle of the night.

`* [/]`
  : I'll need a coffee and a few sheets of paper to figure stuff out.
  
`* [ ]`
  : That's still a knowledge gap.
